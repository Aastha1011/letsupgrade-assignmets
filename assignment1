Question 1

//"122" because "2" is considered as string and hence it gets concatenated.
//"32"  because first "2" has a "+" operator hence it gets added to the 1 and second 2 is considered as a string and is concatenated.
//"02"  because  "1" has a "-" operator hence it gets subtracted from 1 and 2 is considered as a string and is concatenated.
//"112" because every string has "+" operator hence it gets concatenated.
//"NaN2" because "A" and "B" are strings so the output is Not a Number(NaN) so they can't be subtracted and the 2 is concatenated at end.
//"NaN2"  because "A" and "B" are strings so the output is Not a Number(NaN) so they can't be subtracted and the 2 is concatenated at end.

Question 2
You are given a variable “marks”. Your task is to print:
- AA if the mark is greater than 90
- AB if the mark is greater than 80 and less than or equal to 90
- BB if the mark is greater than 70and less than or equal to 80
- BC if the mark is greater than 60 and less than or equal to 70
- CC if the mark is greater than 50 and less than or equal to 60
- CD if the mark is greater than 40 and less than or equal to 50
- DD if the mark is greater than 30 and less than or equal to 40
- FF if the mark is less than or equal to 30
